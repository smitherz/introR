Prior to the start of the workshop everyone will need to have had the software 
installed and tested.  Below are the instructions for installing R and RStudio. 
If you do not have install access to your computer (often called "PR access"), 
you will need to contact your IT representative to have them install it. You can 
give them a link to this page for instructions.

##Install R and RStudio
These instructions are for Windows install. If you have trouble installing R on a Mac or Linux machine, 
please contact us directly at [gs-w_r_admin@usgs.gov](mailto:gs-w_r_admin@usgs.gov).

## Download and install R
Go to [CRAN and download](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) the R installer for Windows. 
Once the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator". 

Type in your PR credentials and click yes.

You can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination
screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\Program Files\R (version number may vary)
![Install Destination screen](/introR/figure/install_destination.png)

At the "Select Components" screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
![Select Architecture](/introR/figure/install_arch_window.png)

At this screen, uncheck 'Create a desktop icon' because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.

##Download and install RStudio
[Download RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install. 
Accept all the default options for the RStudio install.

## CHECK INSTALL

## Open RStudio
Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu.  Start up RStudio.  Once running it should look something like:

![RStudio Window](/introR/figure/rstudio.png)

## Find "Console" window
By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio.  Find that window.  It will look something like:  

![RStudio Console](/introR/figure/rstudio_console.png)

## Copy and paste the code
Click in the window and paste in the code from below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
version$version.string
```

## Verify your installed R version
It should be of version 3.1.X (where X can be any number) or higher. 
3.2.X is fine as well. If you have an older version, please install the newest version 
using the instructions above.

Here is what my R version looks like.
```{r echo=FALSE}
version$version.string
```
